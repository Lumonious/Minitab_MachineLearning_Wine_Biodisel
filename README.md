# Chemometrics Final Exam Projects

This repository contains the projects for the "Introduction to Chemometrics" final exam (CHEM 353), completed by Nuref≈üan Nazlƒ± Y√ºz√ºkƒ±rmƒ±zƒ±. The repository includes two distinct data analysis projects applying key chemometric techniques to chemical datasets.



## üç∑ Project 1: Phenolic Composition Analysis of Wine Samples using PCA

This project explores the classification of wine samples from three distinct geographical regions based on their chemical makeup.

### Objective

The primary goal was to use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and classify wine samples based on their phenolic profiles[cite: 25]. [cite\_start]The study aimed to identify key compounds that differentiate the regions and evaluate the effectiveness of PCA for wine profiling[cite: 25].

### Dataset

  * The dataset contains measurements of **13 phenolic compounds** for **178 wine samples**[cite: 11, 12].
  * The samples originate from three distinct geographical areas: Region A (59 samples), Region B (71 samples), and Region C (48 samples)[cite: 34, 35, 36].
  * A balanced subset of 30 samples from each region was randomly selected for the analysis[cite: 13, 37].

### Methodology

1.  **Data Sub-sampling**: 30 samples from each of the three regions were randomly selected using Excel's "Random Number Generator"[cite: 39].
2.  **PCA Implementation**: Principal Component Analysis was performed in Minitab using the 13 phenolic compounds as variables[cite: 1167, 1168].
3.  **Analysis**: The resulting score plots and loading plots were analyzed to identify sample groupings and determine which phenolic compounds contributed most to the variation between regions[cite: 1171].

### Results

  * **Score Plot**: The analysis revealed distinct clusters for the different regions. [cite\_start]Region A samples were well-separated, while regions B and C showed some overlap, suggesting similar viticultural or environmental conditions[cite: 1174, 1175].
  * **Loading Plot**: Phenolic compounds **X3, X5, and X9** were identified as the primary drivers of regional separation due to their high loadings[cite: 1181].
  * **Conclusion**: PCA proved to be a powerful tool for classifying wines and identifying the chemical markers responsible for regional differences[cite: 1227, 1229].

## ‚õΩ Project 2: Multivariate Calibration of Biodiesel Mixtures using PLS

This project focuses on predicting the concentration of components in biodiesel mixtures using spectroscopic data.

### Objective

The main goal was to develop and evaluate a **Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression model** to predict the concentrations of sunflower oil, biodiesel, and petroleum diesel in ternary mixtures from their Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectra[cite: 1237]. The performance of the PLS model was benchmarked against simple linear regression[cite: 1238].

### Dataset

  * The dataset comprises **FTIR absorbance spectra** for 47 ternary mixtures and 3 pure components (sunflower oil, biodiesel, and petroleum diesel)[cite: 1254].
  * The data was randomly split into a **calibration set** (32 mixtures) and a **validation set** (15 mixtures) to build and test the model[cite: 1255].

### Methodology

1.  **Data Splitting**: The dataset was randomly divided into calibration and validation sets in Excel[cite: 1258].
2.  **PLS Regression**: A PLS model was built in Minitab with the FTIR spectra as predictors and the component concentrations as responses[cite: 1262]. [cite\_start]The optimal number of components was determined using cross-validation[cite: 1263].
3.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using the Standard Error of Cross-Validation (SECV), Standard Error of Prediction (SEP), and analysis of residual plots[cite: 1240, 1264].

### Results

  * **PLS Model Performance**: The PLS model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the concentrations of all three components, yielding low error rates[cite: 1239].
      * **Sunflower Oil**: SECV = 2.40, SEP = 1.86 [cite: 1266]
      * **Biodiesel**: SECV = 1.86, SEP = 0.73 [cite: 1266]
      * **Petroleum Diesel**: SECV = 2.86, SEP = 2.13 [cite: 1266]
  * **Comparison**: The PLS model significantly outperformed simple linear regression, which failed to capture the complex multivariate relationships in the spectral data[cite: 1275, 1282].
  * **Conclusion**: PLS regression is a highly effective and reliable method for analyzing FTIR spectra in fuel quality control, showcasing the importance of advanced chemometric techniques[cite: 1281, 1284].
